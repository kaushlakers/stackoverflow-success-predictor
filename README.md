# stackoverflow-success-predictor
The aim of this system is to estimate a probability of a specific question being “closed” on the technical QA forums. We analyze characteristics of the questions posted, along with the profile of the user posting the question, to build a classifier that will be able to predict if a new question will be answered effectively.
